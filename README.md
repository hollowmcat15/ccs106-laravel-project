## About this project

This project is a Laravel demo of an enrollment system, well, at least it looks like it. You can mess around with it idc. Migrations are also there if you want to interact with the database, in this case I use phpmyadmin/mysql.

## Some other mentions

This project is catered towards two types of individuals: the <u>user</u> and the <u>chairman</u>. While you can actually use the user functions for the website, there is also a secret page for accessing the chairman section since I made it inaccessible for obvious reasons. 

To do it you must:

- open up vscode or an code editor of your choice
- use the terminal on vscode or any terminal that has php in it
- type "php artisan serve"
- open up the link in the browser
- once you are in the homepage, add /chairman_home next to the link
